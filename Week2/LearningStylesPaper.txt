I believe our learning is affected by the methods we each prefer to use. Learning is a personal thing. Each individual has their own ways to help them learn and progress farther. However, the sentiment that we are fixed to JUST one style of learning isn't true. In reality, we all use a little bit of varius styles to help us learn. I'm a visual learner, but I also use a lot of tactile methods in the way I learn. I have to see things with my eyes as well as write down the information for repitition. Incorperating hands on tactics helps me to better cement the ideas and images in my head. I have to SEE and also FEEL for things to become real to me. Auditory also helps to solidify the information in my head, but overall I use auditory less than the other two styles. On the contrary, some experts don't believe that learning styles exist, which I disagree with. I had a physics teacher in high school who taught the class solely on lectures. She never used books or pictures for examples. She just explained everything by talking. What's more egregious is that she urged us not to right down any notes so we can keep our full attention to her. I almost failed her class because I couldn't remember anything she taught. I could not make out any images in my head to understand the concepts. The next school year I took biology, and the teacher showed us notes on the projector for us to write down and he would always explain in thorough detail as he read through the notes. He used plenty of pictures and even made us do hands on projects to help better understand each concept. I was one of the top students in that class. It's just one example, but from my own personal experience I believe we do have our own preffered styles, but that doesn't mean we can't use other methods to help us better understand something. It's not so black and white. We're humans. We see, hear, and touch. It's only natural to use all of our senses.
