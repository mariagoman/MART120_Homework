        <br>

        <p style="text-align: center;">Under The Tuscan Sun is about a divorced woman who spontaneously buys an old villa in Italy. From there she makes new friends<br>
        and finds a new meaning to her life. It is a moving story about redemption. This movie has breathtaking cinematography of the Italian<br>
        countryside and it makes me pine for a country I've never been to before. This is such a comfort movie for me.</p>
