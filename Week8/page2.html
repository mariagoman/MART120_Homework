        <br>

        <p style="text-align: center;">Legally Blonde is one of the best chick flicks ever made in my opinion. The main character, Elle Woods, is misunderstood and is percieved as a "dumb blonde" by others.<br>
        She proves them wrong by going to Harvard Law School and succeeding. Elle never loses her kindness even when people treated her terribly. She is an example that you <br>
        can be strong and intelligent without losing touch of your femininity.</p>
