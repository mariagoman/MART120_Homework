A command line interface (CLI) is an interface that allows users to type in specific commands into a text-based terminal to do tasks. A graphical user interface (GUI) is a type of interface that allows users to interact with a computer system by using icons, buttons, menus, and other varius graphic elements. Each interface is utilized depending on the preference of the user. CLI's are more difficult to use, whereas GUI's are more easy to learn. However, GUI's can be very limiting to developers, so CLI's give more flexibility to execute customized commands. CLI's are also faster than GUI's, which comes in handy because it requires fewer resources to execute specific commands. The flexibility and speed of CLI's are preferred by advanced programmers and developers, while GUI's are more user-friendly for beginner or casual users.
