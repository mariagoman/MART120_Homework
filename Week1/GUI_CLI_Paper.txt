For coding, there are two main interfaces used to interact with a computer system. A command line interface (CLI) is an interface that allows users to type in specific commands into a text-based terminal to do tasks. A graphical user interface (GUI) is a type of interface that allows users to interact with a computer system by using icons, buttons, menus, windows, dialog boxes, and other varius graphic elements. Each interface is utilized depending on the specific task and personal preference of the user. I will briefly list the strengths and weaknesses of both interfaces. CLI's are more difficult to use, whereas GUI's are easier to learn and more user-friendly. However, GUI's can be very limiting to developers, so CLI's give more flexibility to execute customized commands. CLI's are also faster than GUI's which comes in handy because it requires fewer resources to execute specific commands. However, in addition to the steep learning curve, CLI’s are prone to errors if precise syntax isn’t used. Users are therefore required to remember specific syntaxes and codes. Overall, it boils down to the preference of the user. The flexibility and speed of CLI's are preferred by advanced programmers and developers, while GUI's are more user-friendly for beginner or casual users.
