        <h1>The Prince of Egypt</h1>

       <br>

       <p>The Prince of Egypt is an animated depiction of the story of Moses from the Bible. The animation is breathtaking and the musical<br>
        scores are very well composed. The movie is also respectful to the source material. All around, it is a very powerful and unforgettable<br>
        film. I wish DreamWorks made more movies like this. </p>
