        <h1>Under The Tuscan Sun</h1>

        <br>

        <p>Under The Tuscan Sun is about a divorced woman who spontaneously buys an old villa in Italy. From there she makes new friends<br>
        and finds a new meaning to her life. It is a moving story about redemption. This movie has breathtaking cinematography of the Italian<br>
        countryside and it makes me pine for a country I've never been to before. This is such a comfort movie to me.</p>
