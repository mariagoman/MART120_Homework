I had a very hard time thinking about what I wanted to make. Given that I'm just a beginner at coding, it's hard to make stuff with the little knowledge I have. 
So I searched up simple project ideas to make with basic Javascript and one of the recommendations was to make a playlist and I thought it would be a good idea.
I used to love listening to LoFi music playlists on YouTube so I thought this could be a project I would enjoy doing. Plus, I could add my own aesthetic cover art in the background.
I want to at least make something I enjoy would doing rather than something I would abhore.
